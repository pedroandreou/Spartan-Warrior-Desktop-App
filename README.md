## ðŸ“° Description
The main idea of my game is based on Greek mythology; however, I have taken some artistic freedom in changing the original story-line. As the original story goes, King Odysseus of Ithaca was married to Penelope. At the end of the Trojan War, Odysseus started his journey back home but was believed by many to have died en route. Penelope, however, knew it in her heart that her husband was still alive. Tradition at the time had it that should a king die, his wife was to remarry. However, as Penelope did not believe her husband to be dead, she was holding off as long as possible. As the story goes, Odysseus took ten years to make it back home, as he had upset Poseidon, the god of the sea, by blinding his son. In my story, I replaced Odysseus the king of Ithaca, with the Spartan King and warrior, Leonidas. That is because Leonidas is a much more famous character, that has been popularized by Hollywood. The game has got many sounds which catch the playerâ€™s attention and enhance user experience
